# Reflection

## Effective Components of the dashboard:
-	Our two research questions focused on different areas: total of imports/exports in USD, in addition to the relationship of imports/exports as a percentage of GDP. By being able to view both time-series and cross-functional data within the same screen, we were successfully able to capture both research questions, and a user has to scroll minimally to get the takeaways.
-	The ability to look at time-series data for an individual country enables users to see imports/exports around internal and external conflicts.


## Areas of Improvement/Enhancement for the dashboard:
-	The arms dataset that was chosen was incomplete, and in the earlier years of data available, there are very few countries in the dataset, in addition to other challenges such as gaps in year data, and there were changes to country borders over 30 years. To mitigate this, we could have chosen to look at a smaller time horizon that had more complete data or restricted the regions that were looked at (ie. looked only at North America rather than globally). 
-	The original intention was to have a “Country” callback included in the app, which would have allowed users to interactively select a country in the map and the time-series data for that country would have shown below. This was not technically feasible given the time frame, and so we opted for a dropdown where users can select the country that they would like to see time-series data for.
-	On the map, your eye is immediately drawn to the US since it is such a major player in worldwide arms trade. For the given scale, since the US dominates so heavily, it is difficult to see the subtleties for changes of many other countries. To remove the effect of the US, an additional map could be included that excludes the US, with a scale that would more effectively capture smaller changes in other countries.
-	To expand our dashboard, an improvement could be to overlay indicators on individual country time-series data that would show timelines of significant conflicts by country. We opted out of this option as we thought it would be a nice-to-have, rather than a necessity given our chosen research questions.
