# Report on Global Weapon Trade and its Relationship with GDP

## About
This repository was created as part of an assignment in [UBC's Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program. The goal of the assignment is to create an interactive dashboard that effectively visualizes specified research questions.

[The interactive dashboard can be found here](https://app.slack.com/client/T17KZ4CR4/GQSQS6V1U)

## Description 

The app has a single landing page that shows four plots that change based on a slider bar that changes the year shown, and three buttons. The three buttons specify import, export and net import (imports less exports) of weapons for each country globally.  All four graphs change according to the button selected. The first graph is a global choropleth of each country with the colour shaded to the scale generated by the button selected. The bar graph below has a set of countries of interest (selections will be made that appropriately show major importers/exporters) with their import, export or net import (based on the button) plotted as a percentage of GDP. For both the global choropleth plot, and the percentage of GDP plot, the data plotted changes with a slider bar that changes the year. The global choropleth chart is interactive, and you can select a country on the map. The data for that country is displayed on the bottom two graphs. The default of the bottom 2 charts will show USA data. This allows a comparison between global changes and the specified country. The data plotted for the bottom two country specific graphs does not change with the year slider, however a line moves along the two graphs that highlights the year selected by the slider bar to enable easy comparison.

Please see the [Proposal](proposal.md) to further understand the purpose, motivation, data and research questions behind the report.
