# Proposal

### Motivation and Purpose
One of the key topics in the October 2019 Canadian Federal Election was [gun control]( https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/10/02/how-are-the-federal-parties-tackling-public-safety-and-gun-violence/) and how parties would respond to the shocking increase in gun violence. In the United States, the Second Amendment, or the right to bear arms is baked into the [Bill of Rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). These are two examples that have been polarizing to North Americans, but the use of weapons including guns is a worldwide issue, and not only in relation to war and terrorism. It is clear that weapons move around the world, and the technologies available for weapon production varies between countries. What is less clear is where weapons move from and to, and how significant the movement of weapons is in global and national economies. We would like to use our dashboard to explore how import, export, and net import (imports less exports) of weapons is reflected in economies around the world both over time and comparatively.
